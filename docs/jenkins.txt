Notes on how to install and use Jenkins
=======================================



Initial Work
============
  From:

    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/

  Process:

    wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
    rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key

    yum -y install jenkins

   
    systemctl start jenkins.service
    systemctl enable jenkins.service
    systemctl status jenkins.service


Configuration
=============
 
    http://localhost:8080

    Select plug-ins.
      TODO: Set up your team standards

    Admin User
    ISSUE: Your first "admin user" must have a stupid simple password.

Usage
=====

  My notes are based on learning Jenkins as I document it. If you know 
  what you're doing, feel free to skip this part.  :)

  On http://localhost:8080/newJob
    "Enter an item name"  -> perl_test
    Select "Freestyle project"
    "OK"

  Adding a user
  =============

  https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Standard+Security+Setup

  Once you click "Save" it seems to lose the page so you have to go back.
  Click "Create an account" with the name you just added.

  Login as your new account.
  Upper right corner, click your name.
  Left side menu, click Configure.
  Down the page, add your ssh public key.
  Click Save.
