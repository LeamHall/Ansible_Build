Build Infrastructure
====================

* Webserver for Kickstarts
  https://192.168.1.200/ks

  See script "ks_writeri.pl" at https://github.com/LeamHall/ks_writer
  Kickstart files are text and readable. You can change default
  configurations by editing the files in "input/"


* ISO based build repo
  http://192.168.1.200/repo/[6,7]/Server

  The Kickstart points here for RPM packates. Having it a loop
  mounted ISO image makes life easy. Since I used the same image
  for the boot disk in the KVM files it eliminates kernel mis-
  matches.


* The Kickstart files are very minimal. The assumption is that
  Ansible or similar will be used to configure each host. 


* For KVM based hosts I use the same ISO as the Server repo. See
  the "kvm_writer.pl" script at  https://github.com/LeamHall/ks_writer


* When using Ansible you have to specify hosts in /etc/ansible/hosts.
  A nodename (other than localhost) must be in there to hit via ansible, 
  the node name must also be findable via DNS, /etc/hosts, or the like.
  Groups are useful in that you can affect single hosts or entire
  groups. Grouping is a study unto itself.

    [b2532_vms]
    web01
    web02
    db01
    db02

    [b2532_web]
    web01
    web02

    [b2532_db]
    db01
    db02


* Sample command. This sets the basic configs:
  
  ansible-playbook playbooks/new_server.yml -K --limit=b2532_vms

  For the above to work:
    Must be run as an active account on each host.
    That account must have ssh access.
    That account must have sudo rights.
